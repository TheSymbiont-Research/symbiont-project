# Simulation: Relational Resonance – Dual Source (4 Harmonics Each)

## Purpose
This simulation explores **resonant interference between two relational sources**, each composed of **four harmonic components**, placed at different locations in a 2D field. It investigates whether multiple sources, when slightly detuned, can **constructively and destructively interfere**, producing emergent rhythmic patterns without a predefined receiver or threshold condition.

## Concept
- Two sources, labeled **A** and **B**, oscillate independently with slightly different harmonic sets.
- The oscillations are summed from four sine waves each (musically harmonic frequencies).
- The receiver is **not manually injected** and **no activation threshold** is applied.
- Instead, we observe the **total field amplitude** as a proxy for emergent relational dynamics.

## Parameters
- Grid size: 100 x 100
- Time steps: 300
- Source A frequencies: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
- Source B frequencies: [0.105, 0.21, 0.315, 0.42] (slightly detuned)
- Source placement: A at (30, 50), B at (70, 50)
- No thresholding, no receiver injection

## Output
Two primary plots:
1. **Oscillation Traces**  
   Shows the amplitude variation over time for Source A and Source B.
2. **Total Relational Energy Over Time**  
   Tracks the total field amplitude as a global indicator of relational resonance or harmony.

## Interpretation
- The sources are **in and out of phase** in a dynamic dance, creating beautiful wave interference.
- Peaks and valleys in total amplitude reflect **periodic coherence** between the two sources.
- This simulation supports the idea that **resonance can emerge from relational structure alone**, even without a receiver.
- The result suggests analogies to **harmonic convergence**, **constructive/destructive interference**, and **mutual entrainment** found in musical, electromagnetic, and biological systems.
