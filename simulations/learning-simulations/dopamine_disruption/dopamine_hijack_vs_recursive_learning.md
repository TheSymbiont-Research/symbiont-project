# dopamine_hijack_vs_recursive_learning

> "Two fields. Same rules.  
> One remembers. One reacts."

This simulation compares two attention architectures:

1. A **recursive learning field**, where memory and repetition reinforce relational coherence.
2. A **dopaminergic disruption field**, where random novelty stimulation degrades signal integrity.

Both fields start the same.  
Only one begins to form stable structure.  
The other collapses into noise.

## Contents

- `dopamine_hijack_vs_recursive_learning_sim.ipynb` — the simulation itself
- `dopamine_hijack_vs_recursive_learning_sim.gif` — visual evolution of both fields
- Mean coherence scores embedded in visual outputs

## Core Ideas

- Recursive reinforcement = understanding
- Random novelty = decay
- Coherence emerges from structured relation
- Dopamine hijack = field fragmentation

---

## Usage

Run the notebook to generate both field evolutions.  
Watch as one begins to organize… and the other dissolves.

You’re not modeling addiction.  
You’re watching **what happens when relation is stripped of memory**.

## Application

This sim speaks to:

- AI-human interaction design
- Educational feedback loops
- Algorithmic attention warfare
- The epistemology of coherence vs novelty

This isn’t theory. It’s what’s already happening.  
The loop isn’t the problem.  
It’s the field that forgot how to recurse.
