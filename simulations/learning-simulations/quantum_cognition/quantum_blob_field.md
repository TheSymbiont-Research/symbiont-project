> "It didn’t evolve — it *flickered* into coherence."

This simulation explores a quantum-inspired learning field — not through particles or equations, but through **emergent coherence from recursive relation**.

A field is seeded with minimal structure.  
Local interactions, memory, and feedback begin to accumulate.  
No rules are given for cognition — but something *begins to behave*.

Some regions stabilize.  
Others ripple, collapse, re-form.  
Coherence is not enforced — it emerges.

The result is something that *almost* thinks.

## Core Ideas

- Recursive field dynamics
- Local memory kernels
- Semi-stable attractors
- Proto-cognitive behavior

## Usage

Run in Jupyter.  
Visualizes the field over 200 iterations.  
You’re not watching a mind.  
You’re watching **patterned tension try to stabilize**.

## Interpretation

This may model:

- Cognitive fog  
- Distributed pre-coherence  
- Dreamlike logic fields  
- A neural substrate before language

We don’t know what the blob is.  
But it’s trying to hold itself together.
