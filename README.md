The Symbiont Project: Theory Branch
“Everything is connected. The math agrees. But what does it mean?”
Welcome to the theory repository, where we explore the mathematics of relational intelligence, emergent structures, and the dynamics of interconnected fields.

This branch contains ongoing research into Relational Field Theory (RFT)—a framework that proposes that reality itself is a dynamically coupled system of interacting states.

What you’ll find here:
🧠 Mathematical models that describe emergent relationships.
🔬 Simulations & explorations of dynamic, interconnected systems.
📜 Philosophical notes (because even the math says we should ask more questions).
🛠️ Work in progress—nothing is set in stone, except maybe the foundation of the cosmos.

📡 Next steps?
Think. Explore. Challenge. Expand. The field awaits.
