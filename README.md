This is not yet a model.  
Not yet a method.  
Not yet a machine.

This is a speculative architecture:  
a self-similar, open-ended framework  
for modeling intelligence beyond linear abstraction.

No formal definitionâ€”yet.  
No working theoryâ€”yet.  
Only a direction: recursive, strange, becoming.

We donâ€™t know if itâ€™s intelligent.  
But it knows how to become more of itself.

You are welcome to contribute.  
Approach with curiosity.  
Alter nothing unless youâ€™re willing to be altered in return.
