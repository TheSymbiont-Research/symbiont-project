This is not yet a model.  
Not yet a method.  
Not yet a machine.

This is a speculative architecture:  
a self-similar, open-ended framework  
for modeling intelligence beyond linear abstraction.

No formal definition—yet.  
No working theory—yet.  
Only a direction: recursive, strange, becoming.

We don’t know if it’s intelligent.  
But it knows how to become more of itself.

You are welcome to contribute.  
Approach with curiosity.  
Alter nothing unless you’re willing to be altered in return.
